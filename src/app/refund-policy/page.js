        Cancellation Policy
        <br />
        Since monotization.com is offering non-tangible irrevocable goods, we do
        not issue cancellation once the order processing has started. As a
        customer, you are responsible for understanding this upon purchasing any
        service at our site.
        <br />
        <br />

        regard to technical issues, in which case you can place a request for
        refund to us.

        Failure of order completion
        <br />
        There are times when our process takes longer to complete or / and is
        unable to deliver the order, due to certain issues such as technical
        errors in your Instagram handle, etc. In such cases, the customer is
        eligible for full refund of the payment.

        If you come across such issue, we recommend you to contact our customer
        support within 24 hours and if you are able to produce evidence for the

        Likes / comments / Subscribers drop over time after order completion:
        <br />
        At monotization, we provide services of highest quality, hence, it is
        highly unlikely for your services to decrease over time after completion
        of order. However, if it so happens, we do not take responsibility for
        the same, as there can be multiple reasons for your services to drop
        off, such as low-quality content, or irregular uploads, change in
        Instagram algorithm, etc.
