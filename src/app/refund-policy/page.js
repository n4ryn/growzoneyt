        <strong>Refund Policy</strong>
        <br />
        Please read our refund policy carefully to understand if you are
        eligible for a refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a customer of GrowZoneYT, you acknowledge that we provide intangible
        digital goods and services which are non-refundable and non-reversible.

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Customer Support</strong>

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>
        <br />
        Since GrowZoneYT delivers non-tangible, irrevocable digital services,
        cancellations are not accepted once an order is in process. You are
        expected to understand this condition before making a purchase.
        <br />
        <br />
        That said, we understand that exceptional circumstances may
        arise—particularly technical issues. In such cases, you may request a
        refund under the conditions below.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eligibility for Refund</strong>
        <br />
        <em>1. Incomplete or failed delivery:</em>
        <br />
        If an order fails to complete due to technical issues—such as problems
        with your account or other unexpected errors—you may be eligible for a
        full refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>2. Services not as described:</em>
        <br />
        If the delivered service significantly differs from what was promised,
        please contact our support team within 24 hours. If you can provide
        clear evidence, a partial or full refund may be issued depending on the
        order status.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Non-Refundable Situations</strong>
        <br />
        <em>Service drop after completion:</em>
        <br />
        While GrowZoneYT offers top-quality services, we do not take
        responsibility for likes, comments, or subscribers dropping after
        successful delivery. Drops may occur due to factors such as account
        inactivity, low content quality, or platform algorithm changes.
